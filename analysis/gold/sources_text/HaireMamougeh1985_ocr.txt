Haire Mamougeh

{Armenia )

Susan and Gary Lind-Sinanian supplied the following notes when they presented the dance at the 1985
University of the Pacific Folk Dance Camp. Their sources are Arsen Anoushian, Hourig Sahagian, Eddie
Keosian and Sossy Kadian, Armenian people with whom they do dance research in New Enqland.

"Haire Mamougeh (HIGH-ruh mah-MO0O-gay} is a delightful Armenian wedding dance for the ‘khanamee’ Cin-
laws}, and comes from Rustoon, in the province of Van. The name probably derives from ‘Hayr ou Mamoug
eh' (the father and the grandmother). These two roles were quite influential in the traditional family
structure.

in many areas of Armenta, the newly married bride and groom traditionally were not permitted to dance
at their own wedding. As the ‘King and Queen of the day,' they were required to sit on thrones and
watch the festivities, rather than actively participate. They were never addressed by their actual
names at the wedding, instead being referred to as ‘Takavour ou Takouhie' (the King and Queen), or as
‘Yergou Bzaghig' (the two flowers}. These customs probably were vestigal practices from pre-Christian
times.

In this dance, the bride’s family and the groom's family form two separate lines facing each other.
The lines advance towards each other and then back away, as the dancers sing. The lyrics of the song
praise the new in-laws in the opposite line, and each side alternates praising the other. (We have not
been able to locate the lyrics for this song at this time). The dance vividly illustrates several im-
portant principles of Armenian family life. The separate lines for each family recognize the solidar-
ity and cohestveness of the members of each family. The cooperation of the familfes needed for the
dance formation. and reciprocity exhibited in the singing reflects between the two families. (Note:
the term ‘khanamee’ (in-laws) in Armenian culture does not have the negative connotations often assa-
ciated with the English word. It is a very positive, cherished relationship)."

FORMATION: Two Jines of dancers facing each other about 6' apart. Within the lines hands are joined
in "Armenian hold”: JTittle fingers linked with hands at shidr level, albows bent and
down. One line represents the family and friends of the bride - the other those of the
groom,

ST¥LING: Carriage Is erect, but the knees maintain a slight flex throughout the dance and the steps
have a strong solid quality. The steps are comparatively small and restrained, but the
whole body is invotved in them ~ not just the feet. Maintain eye contact with opposite
person - a friendly interchange and acceptance of each other Is important.
