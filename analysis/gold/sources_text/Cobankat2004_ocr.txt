Cobankat

(Albania)

Cobankat (choh-BAHN-kaht) means “The Shepardesses.” It is a traditional song of the “Tosk” people of
Albania. The words extol the freedom to be found in the mountains of Albania. Lee Otterholt put typical
Albanian steps to the melody. This description records the dance as Lee presented it at the 2004 Stockton Folk

Dance Camp.
