                                                    Abdala
                                                    (Bulgaria)
Abdala (AHB-dah-lah), sometimes known as Vlasko Dajcovo, was learned by Yves Moreau during March, 1970
from Nikola Vajtusev, a 75 year old man from the village of Vrav, Vidin District in N.W. Bulgaria. This type of
dance is quite common throughout several villages along the Danube in N.W. Bulgaria. It is danced by "Vlachs"
(Romanian minorities). The dance was presented by Yves Moreau at the 1991 University of the Pacific Folk
Dance Camp.
The term "Vlachs" is used in several ways in the Balkans. Most people agree that Vlachs originally came to
Bulgaria from Southern Romania ("Wallachia"), and were for a long time nomadic people who settled primarily in
Northwest Bulgaria, Northeast Serbia, Macedonia, and Northern Greece. The term is also used in North Bulgaria
to denote the "Banat Bulgarians", who originally fled Bulgaria to settle in Romania, later to renirn to their
homeland. Their language and folklore are mixtures of Romanian and local elements.
