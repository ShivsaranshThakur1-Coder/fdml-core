Aalistullaa
(Finnish)

Aalistullaa (AH-ah-liss-tool-lah) is a couple dance of the Réntyska type from Ingeria, the region around St.
Petersburg which had a Finnish speaking majority until World War IL. It was taught by Jussi Aronen and
Lennu Ylaneva at the 1999 University of the Pacific Stockton Folk Dance Camp. The name has no known
meaning. Research by Jussi Aronen and Viola Malmi indicates that the Rontyska dances are derived from the
classic quadrilles (originally from France) danced by the upper classes in St. Petersburg. ‘Traditionally, they
were in six parts with a pause between each. In this region, a strong tradition of singing while dancing led to
the adding of song to the quadniles. In the case of Aalistullaa the lyrics are mostly nonsense sounds, probably
corrupted from Russian words; at least one phrase (kakkunassi) seems derived from the Russian "kak u nas"
meaning to do something "our way." This type of dance is also popular in nearby areas of Finland. The origin
of the word "réntyska" is controversial. Most researchers accept that it comes from the Russian
"frantsuskaya" meaning French, and subsequently was modified by the local Finnish dialect. An alternative
theory, also plausible, is that it came from the Finnish verb "réntyskaa" meaning to do something in a careless
or tired way, and perhaps describing an unsophisticated or peasant way of doing the quadrilles. The musician
for this recording was Timo Hukkanen,

CD: 1999 Tanhukurssi, Band 11. 4/4 meter

Formation: Two formations are possible for this dance.
A) In the original form of the dance cpls form a single open circle facing in. Cpl | is at the R
(CCW) end of the line. In this form, the dance can be done with as few as 5 cpls. W 1s 1. of ptr
with M L and W R hands joined in V-pos.
B) For large recreational groups, make 2 concentric circles of cpls with each mner circle cpl
facing an outer circle cpl. W is L of ptr, same as in original formation. If the group of dancers is
not large enough to make a complete circle, an open circle works fine.

Steps: Walking: 1 step to act, 4 per meas; may begin with either ft.
Ruaoning: Small low steps, 1 to a ct; may begin with either ft.

Scuff Step: Step or low leap onto R (ct 1); scuff L heel fwd near R A (ct &); repeat with opp
frwk (cts 2,&).

Twirl: Face ptr and join hands palm to palm (ML, WR and MR, WL). Hald hands. out fo
side about shidr level with elbows slightly bent. Circle CW with 8 steps (meas 1-2) and then
CCW 8 steps (meas 3-4). May also be danced with opp.

Styling: Dance is fast moving and lively. Dancers should sing along with the music as much as possible.
As the words are mostly nonsense sounds, the exact pronunciation is not important.
